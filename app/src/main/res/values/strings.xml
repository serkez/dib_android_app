    <string name="about_message">dib is a service that provides resources to people without smartphones or internet access. This enables people to access crucial information, such as directions despite not having internet access.\nThis is a prototype for a dib app. This, if built as its intended will access the SMS of a user\'s phone to send messages to a Twilio API phone number which can then handle the internet-required task and send the user a response via SMS. \nRight now, the app simulates the responses by using predetermined responses instead of accessing real data via SMS and APIs. This app serves as a model for the visual aspects of the dib app with hints of future functionality.</string>
